                            <p>I have been working with artforms a many my whole life.  It has always been my passion and as I am sure you find it easeier to work with what you enjoy these kind of projects ar what I am willing to devote my whole self to.  In addition to that because it is a passion I have worked with may a medium in the past, and though different art mediums are by no means the same when it comes to performance I think most can find that the simalarities that are there do help each of us move from one medium to another.</p>
                            <p>The other advantage I have is my absolute persistence.  Once I start something I can't put it down until it is finished, or it will bother me.  So even if I don't know something right off the bat due to my lack of experice you can trust me to put in the time to figure it out.</p>
