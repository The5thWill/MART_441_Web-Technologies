This being the first project was honestly a vey good refresher, it has been a year since I took my first web design course and although this project was not difficult it helped me remember much of what I had forgotten.  I am happy we got this refresher before going on to new topics.  For my project I went ahead and just focused on introducing myself properly and making it look good while reflecting my love for art and nature in the background I hope you like it.
